# Blazorball
 
Blazorball is a work-in-progress multiplayer game built with ASP.NET Core 3.1 Blazor (Server).

The game is designed to be played in person or over a group call with screenshare support, with one person acting as host and the rest connecting to the game with their mobile devices or computers. It is a physics-based (using Matter.js) football-them-up.

# Currently WIP

Currently, the teams management and joining is implemented to the webapp, in addition to the implementation of matterjs and some start-of-game things like showing the client UI, building the world, etc. However, any actual gameplay is not finished, so it'll be quite a boring gameplay experience! This will get finished and perfected over the next two weeks.

# Setup

If you just want to play the game, it is available at [https://blazorball.xyz](https://blazorball.xyz) and you need to do none of these steps.

To build and run this project, you need .NET Core 3.1 installed on your system and something like Visual Studio to open the project. This project is also configured to use Docker. You will need Docker tools installed to compile and run with Docker.
